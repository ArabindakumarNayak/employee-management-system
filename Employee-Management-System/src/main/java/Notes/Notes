Given that there is no default password encoder configured, each password must have a password encoding prefix. 
Please either prefix this password with '{noop}' or set a default password encoder in `DelegatingPasswordEncoder`.

Though a little late, here is what I found:

If you want to store the password as plaintext you will have to prefix it with {noop}. 
Default PasswordEncoder i.e DelegatingPasswordEncoder should take care of matching it. 
For e.g. if your plaintext password is abc123ABC you will have to store it in database as {noop}abc123ABC

(Valid for Spring Security 5.x onwards)

mysql> select * from user;
+----+----------+----------+
| id | password | username |
+----+----------+----------+
|  1 | {noop}a  | Arabinda |
|  2 | r@1234   | Raju     |
+----+----------+----------+

if you are going to put username as "Arabinda" and password as "a" then it going to access.
otherwise its going to get the error like Unauthorized.
